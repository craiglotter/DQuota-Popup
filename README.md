DQuota-Popup
============

The university of Cape Town uses Novell NetWare as its network management tool of choice. DQuota is a program bundled in the JRBUtils utility suite for managing NetWare. DQuota Popup creates a customised popup window for Commerce I.T., utilising dquota.exe's output to inform the user logging in about their current network disk utilisation.
